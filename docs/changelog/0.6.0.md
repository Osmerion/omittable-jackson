### 0.6.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Overview

The modules providing support for integrating [Omittable](https://github.com/Osmerion/Omittable) with third-party
libraries and frameworks have been split off into their own repositories to simplify development of current and future
integrations.

This repository now only contains the code for the `com.osmerion.omittable:omittable-jackson` artifact.

#### Improvements

- Serialization of omittable properties now always behaves as if `JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT` was configured.
  - Consequentially, it is no longer required to configure property inclusion for omittable properties.
- The Jackson module now supports auto-registration via the JDK's service-loader mechanism.

#### Fixes

- The jackson-databind module is now required transitively when using this library on the module-path.
